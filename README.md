# NFT collection to experiment with custom implementation of ERC721 and ipfs client 

## Scope
The scope of this project is to experiment with the different aspects of a dApp for NTFs. This includes:
1. My personal implementation of an ERC721 contract -> `MyERC721.sol`
2. NFT minter contract -> `ElefantVonHintenNFT.sol`
3. Integration of ipfs features using the `ipfs-http-client` and infura.io
